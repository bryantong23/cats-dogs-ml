# Cats vs. Dogs CNN Model

64x3 CNN Model built using keras and tensorflow framework to classify images of cats and dogs, based off of Microsoft kaggle competition. Utilized TensorBoard optimization in order to determine most effective model structure, resulting in 3 layer convolutional neural network with train and validation accuracy approaching 90% and train and validation loss approaching 40%.
